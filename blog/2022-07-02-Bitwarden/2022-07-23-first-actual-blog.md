### Why Get Bitwarden/Vaultwarden ?

We know it ain't easy to memorise passwords, hence we use the same passwords everywhere.  
  and sometimes they are pretty easy ones.

Using an easy to remember password doesn't seem like a big deal until finding out that a popular hacking method actually uses a bot to try out a number of common passwords until one sticks. You can check if your password have been compromised [here](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

Among the most common passwords found in leaks in 2020 are the sneaky "qwerty", the obvious "password" and the ubiquitous "123456" (or one of it's many variations), which has led lists of the most common password for some years. Using password as your password is truly an international phenomenon, as the new entry "senha" - Portuguese for password - in rank 6 shows.

With Bitwarden you can have Super Strong passwords for your Internet activities and more.  
  
Example of a Recommended Password :  
    Lower + Upper case Letters (that are not words)  
      with a few numericals and some special character such as $ to go along with.
